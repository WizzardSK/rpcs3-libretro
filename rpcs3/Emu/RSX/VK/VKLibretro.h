// the VkInstance, the core creates the VkDevice on it during context
// negotiation - RPCS3's own device setup, with whatever the frontend needs on
// top - and each finished frame is handed to the frontend as an image on that
// device: no copy through the CPU.
//
// Nothing in here knows about libretro's headers; the core fills it in from
// its negotiation callbacks and reads frames out of it in retro_run.
