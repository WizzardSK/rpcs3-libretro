/*
 ********************************
 * VERSION: 2.0
 ********************************
 *
 * - 2.0: Add support for core options v2 interface
 * - 1.3: Move translations to libretro_core_options_intl.h
 *        - libretro_core_options_intl.h includes BOM and utf-8
 *          fix for MSVC 2010-2013
 *        - Added HAVE_NO_LANGEXTRA flag to disable translations
 *          on platforms/compilers without BOM support
 * - 1.2: Use core options v1 interface when
 *        RETRO_ENVIRONMENT_GET_CORE_OPTIONS_VERSION is >= 1
 *        (previously required RETRO_ENVIRONMENT_GET_CORE_OPTIONS_VERSION == 1)
 * - 1.1: Support generation of core options v0 retro_core_option_value
 *        arrays containing options with a single value
 * - 1.0: First commit
